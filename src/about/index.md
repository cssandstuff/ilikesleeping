## About Hanako

{{ include "../_includes/_pic.vto" }}

Drawing has always been Hanako's passion since she was little and she grew up reading manga - and drawing her own - all the time.

After she studied for a degree in Psychology at Goldsmiths College, University of London,  her passion for art re-emerged and led her to pursue a life as an illustrator. She started off her career at several London markets selling her illustration prints, t-shirts and greeting cards before she signed with illustration agency Pickled ink.

After becoming a mother of two children in Japan, she and her family moved to New Zealand in 2014. She now works from home in Titirangi in Auckland. 

Hanako enjoys drawing simple and bold character designs that appeal to children. Her projects have ranged from fiction covers to board books, illustrated non-fiction books and children’s clothing. ​

Her clients include Caterpillar Books, 360 Degrees, Frances Lincoln Children’s Books, Words & Pictures, Oxford University Press, Benesse Holdings, Ronshin, arsEdition, Chicken House and Britannica Books.
